As in previous interviews and testimony, his statements were riddled with misrepresentations, diversions, and outright lies, so much so that <em>The New York Times</em> posted a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-fact-check.html\">fact-check</a>, Vox made a chart of every time Kavanaugh <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/28/17914308/kavanaugh-ford-question-dodge-hearing-chart\">dodged a question</a>, and <em>Current Affairs</em>&amp;apos; Nathan Robinson dissected the testimony in an exhaustive 10,000-word refutation, \"<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/09/how-we-know-kavanaugh-is-lying\">How We Know Kavanaugh Is Lying</a>.\"</p></div>,\n",

Senator Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Kavanaugh about the nomination of William Haynes, former general counsel to the Defense Department, to be a judge on the Fourth Circuit and his knowledge of Haynes&amp;apos;s role in crafting the administration&amp;apos;s detention and interrogation policies. In 2007, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about/press/2007/062607.kavanaugh.html\">NPR</a> reported that, in fact, Kavanaugh had weighed in on the question of detention, advising White House lawyers that Justice Anthony Kennedy \"would probably reject the President&amp;apos;s claim that American combatants could be denied access to a lawyer.\" While previous Supreme Court nominees made the bulk of their documents available, only <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17818210/supreme-court-nominee-kavanaugh-hearing\">4 percent</a> of Kavanaugh&amp;apos;s paper trail was made available to the public, and it begs the question of whether there&amp;apos;s even more documentation countering his testimony on the matters.</p></div>,\n",

       " <div class=\"embed p\" data-reactid=\"201\"><p>In responding to written questions, Kavanaugh repeatedly denied knowledge of Judge Alex Kozinski&amp;apos;s infamously inappropriate conduct, including e-mails (\"Easy Rider Gag List\") and sexual harassment, some of which led to Kozinski&amp;apos;s resignation after 15 women accused him of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski, who was the chief judge on the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and maintained a close relationship. J. D. Vance wrote that Yale Law School dean Amy Chua, who wrote a glittering endorsement of Kavanaugh in <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> told Vance that Kozinski was a \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1044427803356262402/photo/1\">scumbag</a>.\" One of Kozinski&amp;apos;s other former clerks, Heidi Bond, wrote in <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-kozinski-gag-list-emails-senate-hearings.html\">Slate</a> that \"having clerked in his chambers, I do not know how it would be possible to forget something as pervasive as Kozinski&amp;apos;s famously sexual sense of humor or his gag list.\" It was an open secret in the legal community, particularly the very circles that include Kavanaugh.</p></div>]"
